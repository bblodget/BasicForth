## Known Bugs

- [x] **`MOVE` (core.fs) copied the wrong direction on overlap.** `MOVE
  ( addr1 addr2 u )` must be overlap-safe (memmove semantics), but the original
  definition picked the copy direction backwards: `src < dest` (shift right)
  copied low→high and `src > dest` (shift left) copied high→low — both clobbered
  the overlap, producing a byte "smear". Latent because non-overlapping copies
  and `u <= 1` were unaffected, which covered every caller at the time. Found
  2026-06 while building the line editor. Fixed on the `fix-move-cmove` branch
  (swap the two branches; overlap unit test).
- [x] **`CMOVE>` (core.fs) unbalanced the stack when `u = 0`.** The zero-length
  path ran only `2drop`, but the stack still held `( c-addr1 c-addr2 u )` (3
  cells), leaving `c-addr1` behind. (`CMOVE` handled `u = 0` correctly.) Latent
  because no caller passed `u = 0`. Found 2026-06 (same investigation). Fixed on
  the `fix-move-cmove` branch (drop all three cells; `0 CMOVE>` / `0 CMOVE`
  depth tests).
- [x] **`include <directory>` segfaulted.** `open(2)` succeeds on a directory;
  the raw `mmap` syscall then fails returning -errno (-19, ENODEV), but
  `INCLUDED` checked for exactly -1 — so the error code became the file base
  address. Also, an `fstat` error fell into the "empty file → success" path.
  Both checks now route any negative return to the existing cannot-open error
  path. Found 2026-07-06 (a test bug passed a directory to `include`), fixed
  2026-07-10 on the `include-dir-segfault` branch (both architectures;
  integration tests: error message + session survives).

---

## Phase 4: File System and Storage

- [x] Output handles (step 2): `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` (fileid = raw OS fd),
  `write-file`/`write-line ( c-addr u fileid -- ior )`. `platform_write` split
  into `platform_write_fd` with a stdout wrapper; `TYPE`/`EMIT` unchanged.
  Lets a utility write to stderr without corrupting stdout.
- [x] Generic file-access words (step 3): `open-file`, `create-file`,
  `close-file`, `read-file`, `file-size`, and `r/o`/`w/o`/`r/w`/`bin`. fileid =
  raw OS fd, `ior` = 0/positive errno (same model as the output words). New
  `platform_read_file`; `platform_open_file` generalized to
  `platform_open_file_mode` (+ read-only wrapper) and `platform_create_file`;
  `platform_fstat` reports errors. Example `examples/cat.fs`.
- [x] `read-line ( c-addr u1 fileid -- u2 flag ior )` (step 4): one line per
  call — at most u1 chars stored (u2 <= u1), terminator (LF, preceding CR
  stripped) consumed not stored; `flag` false only at EOF with nothing read. A
  line longer than u1 fills the buffer and the rest is discarded so the next
  call starts at the following line (truncation, chosen over ANS continuation);
  no cross-call state, so multiple files / reused fds are always safe. Defined
  in core.fs on top of `read-file` (one byte per read()), so no new asm/platform
  code — a buffered version can replace it later behind the same interface.
- [x] Dynamic memory — ANS MEMORY wordset (`ALLOCATE`/`FREE`/`RESIZE`): a heap
  *separate* from the dictionary, obtained from the kernel on demand via
  anonymous `mmap` (one mapping per allocation, data-only/no-exec). New
  `platform_mmap_anon`; `munmap` reused. `ALLOCATE`/`FREE`/`RESIZE` defined in
  core.fs over `(mmap-anon)`/`(munmap)` primitives, with a one-cell length
  header and a portable allocate-copy-free `RESIZE`, so the internals can be
  re-backed by a finer allocator later. `ALLOCATE 0` returns a non-zero `ior`;
  page-granular, so suited to a few large buffers. This unblocks later ideas
  that need scratch storage (SAVE session log, help text, text-processing lib).
  Still deferred (harder, separate step): *growing the dictionary itself* — a
  `PROT_EXEC` mapping with a movable `HERE` (see WildIdeas / Future-Hardening).
- Block storage / `LOAD` / `LIST` / `THRU` (Forth screens) — **Won't do.** Block
  screens are a historical storage model; BasicForth already loads source from
  files via `INCLUDE`/`INCLUDED`, and the Phase 4 file-access words cover real
  file I/O, so block storage adds little.
- [x] SAVE / persistence of user definitions — source-replay. `save` writes
  interactively-defined words to `session.fs`; an interactive session auto-loads
  it at startup (after core.fs). Capture excludes transient actions (LATEST/STATE
  delta — bare ALLOT/,/C, are not captured), handles multi-line defs, discards
  errored defs; idempotent and
  cumulative. Heap-backed log; REPL hooks `(session-seed)`/`(capture-line)`/
  `(capture-reset)` registered via `(hook!)`; gated to interactive tty sessions
  (`BASICFORTH_SESSION=1`/`0` overrides). See docs/Persistence.md.
  - Persists definitions and direct `to`/`is` assignments (see below), but not
    other runtime state: a `variable`'s contents reload uninitialized, and
    assignments made *indirectly* (a `to`/`is` inside a called word) are not
    saved. Redefinitions accumulate in the file.
  - [x] Persist direct `to`/`is` assignments across `save`/reload. `forth_to`
    (shared by `to` and `is`) sets a one-shot flag in its interpret-mode store
    path; `(capture-line)` reads it via the new `(assign?)` primitive and logs
    the line even though no new word was defined (no SEE record), and
    `(capture-reset)` clears a stale flag from an errored line. A `to`/`is`
    *inside* a called word compiles a store (not `forth_to`), so calling it is
    not over-captured. Still not persisted: indirectly-set state, and `redo`'s
    recompilation (the record is repointed in place; source-replay order doesn't
    encode the rebuild) — both documented in docs/Deferred_Words.md, docs/Redo.md.
- [x] `MARKER` — dictionary restore points (modern replacement for `FORGET`).
  `marker <name>` defines a word that rewinds `HERE`/`LATEST` to before the
  marker, forgetting it and all later definitions. `CREATE ... DOES>` in core.fs
  over `(latest@)`/`(restore-dict)` primitives. See docs/Marker.md. (`FORGET`
  deferred — obsolescent, footgun-prone; BareMetalForth also did marker-only.)
- [x] Session integration for `MARKER`: `-session` forgets the session
  definitions (rewinds to a restore point recorded just past core.fs, so core.fs
  and the session words survive) and `reload` does `-session` + re-`include`
  session.fs — the edit/compile/run loop. session.fs stays *pure definitions*:
  capture is forward-only (a marker run / `-session` moves LATEST backward and is
  not logged) and `reload` sets a one-shot skip flag. Implemented with an
  external restore point (`(session-mark!)`/`(session-restore)` globals) rather
  than a marker-in-the-file, so the file needs no `marker -session` header. See
  docs/Persistence.md.
- [x] `SEE` — source lister. `see <name>` prints a word's definition source
  (exactly as typed; multi-line and comments preserved). Resolves the name and
  matches the live xt, so it shows the definition currently in force and never
  stale source: a redefinition shadows the older one, and a word forgotten by
  `-session`/a marker reports not found. Works for any defining word; no new asm
  primitive. See docs/See.md.
  - [x] **Dictionary source metadata → `see` for *any* word.** Each compiled
    header carries an 8-byte `[SrcId:2][Len:2][Off:4]` record stamped at compile
    time, and a `.bss` source table maps SrcId → absolute file path. `see`
    dispatches on SrcId: `≥1` reads the byte span straight from the source file
    (so `core.fs` and any `include`d file are covered, attributed by *file
    position* not name — no wrong-source edge); `0xFFFF` reports *primitive
    (assembly)*; `0` (typed at the REPL, no file) falls back to the session
    capture log. New primitives `(find-meta)`/`(source-path)`; `platform_getcwd`
    + `make_absolute` keep paths re-openable after a CWD change. This supersedes
    and retired the old post-load seeded text-parser (which recognised
    definitions by defining word and so missed custom-defining-word words and had
    a rare redefinition wrong-source edge — both now gone). See
    docs/See_Metadata.md. Shipped v0.6.0.
- [~] ~~Bug: `INCLUDED` from inside a colon definition underflows the stack~~ —
  **not a bug.** `INCLUDED` is `( c-addr u -- )` per ANS (it leaves nothing on
  the stack; errors are printed, not returned as an ior). The earlier "underflow"
  was an erroneous `included drop` — the `drop` underflowed after the file
  loaded. `: load s" foo.fs" included ;` (no `drop`) works fine, which is what
  `reload` relies on. The SAVE startup still loads session.fs in asm, but that's
  now just a convenience, not a workaround.
- [x] **Fixed: `INCLUDE`/`INCLUDED` left the outer interpreter parsing a freed
  mmap.** `forth_included` overwrote `source_addr`/`source_len`/`to_in` with the
  file's lines but never restored the caller's values, then `munmap`ed the file.
  After the include the outer `forth_interpret_line` parsed from the (now freed)
  mapping. It only "worked" when `include` was the last token of a line *and* the
  file was fully consumed (so `to_in >= source_len` → no deref); any leftover
  token, or a compile-time error inside the file (which leaves `to_in` mid-line),
  dereferenced the freed page — wedging the REPL or **segfaulting** once the SAVE
  capture hooks were active. Fix: `forth_included` now saves the source pointers
  before the line loop and restores them on every loop-exit path (both arches).
  Bonus: tokens after `include <file>` on the same line now run correctly.
- [x] **Help system — docs browser (`man` / `topics` / `apropos`).** Reads the
  `*.md` topics in the colon-separated directories named by `BASICFORTH_DOCS`.
  `topics` lists them, `man <topic>` finds `<topic>.md` (case-insensitive) and
  pages it a screenful at a time, `apropos <keyword>` lists the topics whose file
  contains the keyword. New primitives: `(getdents)` (wraps `getdents64` for
  directory enumeration) and `(docs-path)` (exposes `BASICFORTH_DOCS`); getdents
  and pager buffers are heap-allocated. See Help_System.md. (Per-word
  `help <word>` is deferred to a later "Part A" — see WildIdeas.md.)
- [x] **Interactive tutorial (`tutorial` / `next` / `back`).** Walks a
  `BASICFORTH_DOCS` Markdown file one `## `-heading step at a time, returning to
  the REPL after each step so the reader can type the examples. Reuses the
  docs-browser machinery (file resolution, `read-line`, the pager line-printer).
  See Tutorial_System.md.
- [x] **First tutorial content: "Snake".** `docs/Tutorial/Snake.md` builds a
  playable terminal Snake game step by step, exercising nearly the whole
  language. Finished program in `examples/snake-mini.fs` (load-tested in the
  integration suite). Tutorials are self-contained subjects with descriptive,
  prefix-free names (`tutorial Snake`).
- [x] **Dictionary space raised 64 KB → 256 KB** (`DICT_SPACE_SIZE`, both arches,
  BSS only). The shared dictionary was nearly full once large examples
  (`examples/sort.fs`) loaded alongside `core.fs`; `unused` now reports ~226 KB
  free.

## Phase 5: Graphics and Sound

See docs/Planning.md "Graphics Direction" for the philosophy/roadmap and
docs/Graphics.md for the API.

- [x] Direct device gateway: `(ioctl)` / `(mmap-dev)` primitives
  (`platform_ioctl` / `platform_mmap_dev`), plus `w@`/`w!`/`l@`/`l!` 16/32-bit
  memory access. (step 1b-i)
- [x] Backend-agnostic 2D surface + primitives in `graphics.fs` (`set-surface`,
  `pixel`, `fill-rect`, `clear`, named colors); 32bpp. (step 1a)
- [x] `fill32` fast block-fill primitive; `fill-rect` clips once and fills each
  row in one burst (full-screen `clear` is instant).
- [x] ~~DRM/KMS software-2D backend~~ — built and hardware-validated in v0.8.0,
  **removed** in the SDL pivot (a desktop compositor owns the display, so DRM
  could never show a window; SDL's KMSDRM driver covers the console case).
  In git history: `src/forth/drm.fs`, `tools/drmoff.c`.
- [x] FFI: dynamic-link build (`gcc -nostartfiles`, dictionary mprotect'd RWX),
  `(dlopen)` / `(dlsym)` / `(ccall)` primitives (up to 6 integer/pointer args),
  `ffi.fs` wrappers, libc-based integration tests, docs/FFI.md + `man ffi`.
  Deferred: float args/returns, >6 args, C-to-Forth callbacks.
- [x] `sdl3.fs`: init/window/renderer/streaming-texture bindings; lock-texture →
  `set-surface`; vsync'd present (`sdl-frame` / `sdl-show`); poll-event
  decoding (`sdl-poll`/`sdl-event-type`/`sdl-key`); `tools/sdl3off.c` verifies
  constants/offsets. Dummy-driver integration test (headless).
- [x] Animation demo: `examples/bounce.fs` — bouncing square at the display
  refresh rate (vsync), ESC/q/close to quit
- [x] Interpreted `s"` and `."` (ANS transient-buffer semantics) — STATE-smart
  redefinitions in core.fs; two alternating 256-byte buffers; compile path
  delegates to the ASM primitives so compiled code is unchanged
- [ ] SDL3 in the Pumpkian board image (build from source; bookworm has no
  libsdl3 package) — done in the Pumpkian repo
- [ ] More primitives: lines, circles, blit/sprites
- [ ] Font / text rendering (show characters on the framebuffer)
- [x] Sound output via SDL3 audio: `sound.fs` — `snd-open`/`snd-open?`/
  `snd-close`, `tone` (queued integer square wave, S16 mono 44100), `beep`,
  `snd-wait`, `snd-vol`; no-ops when the device isn't open (games degrade to
  soundless via `snd-open? drop`); wall blips in bounce.fs; dummy-driver
  integration tests; docs/Sound.md + `man sound`
- [ ] SDL_GPU 3D backend behind the surface API (SDL3-only API; see Planning.md)
- [ ] Game demos (snake, sprites)

---

## Phase 6: Robotics

- [ ] GPIO access via /dev/gpiochip (Pumpkin 40-pin header)
- [ ] I2C / SPI sensor communication
- [ ] Real-time control loops

---

## Phase 7: Custom Linux Distribution

- [ ] Minimal Linux image with BasicForth as /sbin/init (PID 1)
- [ ] Boot straight to Forth prompt
- [ ] Built-in editor for standalone development

---

## Phase 8: Threading and Locals

- [ ] Locals word set (section 13) — Gforth-style separate locals stack
  - Separate locals stack (not return stack) to avoid conflicts with >R/R>
  - `{` syntax: `{ a b c -- result }` declares locals, pops from data stack
  - Each local name compiles to a locals-stack-relative fetch
  - TO works with locals (compile a locals-stack-relative store)
  - Reentrant and thread-safe (each thread gets its own locals stack)
  - Required for safe multi-threaded Forth words
- [ ] Threading support (pthreads or clone syscall)
  - Per-thread data stack, return stack, and locals stack
  - Shared dictionary (read-only after compilation)
  - Thread-local state: SOURCE, >IN, STATE, BASE
  - Synchronization primitives (mutex, semaphore)

---

## Future / Usability

- [x] `BASICFORTH_PATH` colon-separated directory search
  - Supports multiple directories separated by `:` (like PATH,
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
  - `BASICFORTH_PATH=/path/to/lib:/path/to/examples`
  - Each directory searched in order when a file is not found in CWD;
    first match wins. Empty segments are skipped.
- [x] Fix `incl_path_buf` for nested INCLUDED calls
  - `forth_included` now saves/restores `file_name_addr`, `file_name_len`,
    and `file_line_num` around the `forth_interpret_line` call, so a nested
    INCLUDE no longer corrupts the parent's error context (it was reporting
    the wrong file AND line).
  - `incl_path_buf` is now scratch-only: on a fallback hit the error name
    stays the original (as-typed) filename rather than the resolved path, so
    no error-reporting state depends on the shared buffer.

---

## Shell-Like Words (pwd / cd / ls / cat / more) — COMPLETE

Navigate and inspect the filesystem from the REPL — hop to another directory
and list or read a file without leaving BasicForth. Most infrastructure already
exists; only `chdir` is a new syscall. See `docs/WildIdeas.md` for the full
write-up. Read-only + navigation first; filesystem mutators (`mkdir`/`rm`/`cp`/
`touch`) are deferred as a separate, riskier class.

- [x] `chdir` platform primitive
  - New syscall wrapper: `SYS_chdir` (80 on x86-64, 49 on ARM64), stubbed in
    both `test_helper_*.s`. Forth bridge `chdir ( c-addr u -- ior )` copies the
    path to a NUL-terminated buffer (over-long → `-ENAMETOOLONG`).
- [x] Capture the startup directory at boot
  - `_start` `getcwd`s into `startup_dir` before `core.fs` loads. `(startup-dir)`
    exposes it. `session.fs` is now pinned to it: `core.fs` builds absolute
    `<startup>/session.fs(.new)` for seed-log / SAVE / RELOAD, so persistence
    never wanders after a `cd`. Regression test guards it.
- [x] `pwd ( -- )` — prints the cwd (← new `(cwd)` primitive over `getcwd`).
- [x] `cd ( "path" -- )` — `chdir` to the parsed token.
  - `cd` with no argument → returns to the startup directory; a failed cd reports
    the offending path.
  - [x] `cd ~` → `$HOME` (`~` / `~/sub` expansion). HOME is captured at boot
    (`(home-dir)`); a leading `~` is expanded in `cd`. HOME unset → `cannot access ~`.
- [x] `ls ( "[dir]" -- )` — list a directory (current by default; optional `<dir>`
    arg supported), one entry per line, skipping `.`/`..` (← `(getdents)`).
- [x] `cat ( "file" -- )` — dump a file to stdout (← chunked `read-file`).
- [x] `more ( "file" -- )` — paged file view (← the existing `page-file` pager).
    Named `more` because `page` already means clear-screen.
- [x] `pushd` / `popd` / `dirs` — a fixed-depth (16) directory stack. `pushd <dir>`
    saves the current dir (absolute) and cd's; `popd` returns to it; `dirs` lists
    current + saved (top first). Stack buffer is heap-allocated lazily.
- [x] Integration tests + docs: `docs/Shell_Words.md` + a "Shell-Like Words"
    Manual section; `platform_chdir`/`platform_getcwd` added to Platform_Layer.md;
    Persistence.md updated for the session.fs startup-dir pin. Documented limit:
    `parse-word` path tokens can't contain spaces in v1.

---

## Module System / Forth-as-Shell

The vision: BasicForth as a *shell* with Forth as the shell language — `cd`
around, `load` a module, interact with it live (`.module`, `see`/`edit`/run
words, `save` back). Shipped across v0.9.0 (2026-07-04) and the merges since;
see docs/Persistence.md, Line_Editor.md, Deferred_Words.md, Shelling_Out.md.

### Shipped

- [x] Named modules replace the magic `session.fs`: `save <name>` / bare
  `save`, `load`, `new`, `reload`, `-session`; `.session` renamed `.module`;
  capture turns on with a file argument.
- [x] `uses <word>` — whole-token, case-insensitive reference search across
  the module's sources (capture log or file), the "what do I touch if I
  rename this?" tool.
- [x] Modal `edit <word>`: spawns `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`/`vi` on a temp file via
  the new `(system)` primitive (fork/execve/wait4; clone on ARM64), so
  multi-line formatting survives; on save it recompiles the word and
  **propagates** to every transitive caller (STC bakes call targets).
- [x] `sh <command>` — run a shell line from the REPL (transient, not
  captured); `(system)` is the underlying primitive.
- [x] `compact <name>` — deduped, dependency-ordered, definitions-only
  snapshot written next to the append-only `save` file; final `is`/`to`
  bindings preserved.
- [x] Dirty-guard: `new`/`load`/`bye` prompt "save first? (y/n)" when the
  module has unsaved changes.
- [x] Typed dictionary headers (Flags2 byte: code/defer/value/noname);
  type-checked `is`/`to`; `defer@`/`action-of`; `see` reports a deferred
  word's current binding.
- [x] `:noname` headers — anonymous definitions carry real source metadata
  (empty name, unfindable by construction), so `see`/`compact`/`edit` handle
  `:noname`-bound defers exactly (multi-line included); fixed the multi-line
  group re-evaluation segfault.
- [x] `uses` + edit-propagation treat `:noname` actions first-class: live
  groups reported as `(:noname is <name>)` and re-run on propagation, with a
  guard so superseded groups are never re-fired.
- [x] Tutorial UX: steps clear the screen; `tutorial <name> [step]` and
  `step [n]` jump/replay (a `value` works as a bookmark argument);
  `end-tutorial`; tty-only pager pause; Chase tutorial (24 steps) and
  `examples/game-template.fs`.
- [x] Robustness fixes found by live use: xorshift64 `rnd` (the old LCG's
  low bit alternated), tabs count as whitespace in the tokenizer, `edit`
  with an untouched file is a no-op (vi `:q!` exits 0).

### Next: the editing-workflow arc (planned 2026-07-08)

Motivating find: a plain interactive redefinition (`: helper 200 ;`) does NOT
propagate — callers silently keep the old code (STC bakes call targets; only
`edit` recompiles callers). Worse, it makes the three persistence views
disagree: live behavior and `save`/`reload` keep callers on the old code,
but `compact` emits the latest source at the word's original position, so
callers would bind the NEW code. `:e` closes the gap and becomes the taught
way to redefine. The full symmetry grid:

|                        | inline | $EDITOR         |
|------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| new word               | `:`    | `define <word>` |
| redefine + propagate   | `:e <word>` | `edit <word>` |

- [x] **Step 1a: `define <word>`** — open `$EDITOR` on a template
  (`: word\n    ;`), evaluate + log on exit, exactly the modal-`edit`
  machinery minus the source lookup. Refuse an existing word ("already
  defined — use edit"), symmetric with `edit`'s errors.
- [x] **Step 1b: bare `edit`** (no argument) — open the *current module
  file* in `$EDITOR`; on exit, if the file changed, `reload` it (unchanged →
  no-op, reuse the `(s=)` compare). Dirty-guard first: unsaved captured
  changes would be lost by the reload, so prompt "save first? (y/n)" like
  `load`/`new`. Requires a current module.

Building Step 1b surfaced a simpler model — reload-based editing makes
propagation correct by construction and stops the save file from
accumulating redefinitions. The original Steps 2–4 were re-planned as the
**file-canonical model, AGREED 2026-07-10 in docs/Module_Architecture.md**
(that doc has the full rationale and hard cases). The staged roadmap:

- [x] **Stage 1: splice machinery** — `save` honors bind vs mutate (the
  hyper-static principle, added to Module_Architecture.md during this
  stage): file text and `:` rebindings kept verbatim in order
  (replay-faithful), `edit`-originated mutations (tagged at capture)
  spliced over the binding they edited; `compact` deprecated.
- [x] **Stage 2: `edit <word>` v2** — temp-file UX + splice + reload
  (replaces propagation). The edit targets the word's newest definition in
  the module file, verifies the span still holds the expected text before
  rewriting (atomic .new+rename), and reloads; the dirty-guard runs before
  any reload (non-interactive sessions refuse instead of discarding).
  Deviation from plan: the temp path is module-adjacent (`<module>.edit`,
  removed after) rather than pid-suffixed — no new syscall, and collisions
  then require two sessions editing the SAME module, which is already a
  conflict. Propagation is now uncalled (deleted in Stage 4).
- [x] **Stage 3: `:e <word>`** — inline redefine + splice + reload.
  Mechanism: `:e` validates the target, arms a one-shot completion hook,
  and EVALUATEs ": <name>" so the rest of the input compiles as a normal
  definition; on completion the group (":e" rewritten to ":") splices the
  file and reloads. Splice failure falls back to a plain unsaved binding.
- [x] **Stage 4: cleanup pass** (2026-07-11) — deleted the propagation body
  (`(propagate)`, `(prop-*)`, `(pmd-*)`; `(eval+log)` survives as `define`'s
  back end with its own `(el-src)` scratch), `compact` + helpers, and the
  whole mutation-tag path: with mutations splicing the file directly, no
  capture group is ever tagged, so `(dir-tags)`/`(cap-tag)` and the entire
  splice-save patch machinery (`(sv-*)`) were dead — `save` is now literally
  "write the log verbatim" (the log = seeded file text + appended bindings),
  and the `(save-impl)` indirection and seed-extent records went with it.
  Dropped the 3 compact tests; fixed the stale ?DO-vs-DO asm comments (both
  arches emit identical code — equal bounds zero-trip for both).
- [ ] **Stage 5: `module <file>` + ownership** — `.module` filters by
  SrcId, foreign-word refusal with a hint, dependency edits splice into
  their own file (one reload propagates through the `include` chain).
- [ ] **Stage 6 (gated on use testing): auto-sync** — the file stays in
  sync as you type; explicit `save` and the dirty-guard retire;
  rollback-on-broken-reload if the fix loop proves insufficient.
  Checkpointing convention meanwhile: **git through `sh`**.

### Use-testing queue (Brandon's v0.10.0 notes, 2026-07-13)

- [x] Quick wins (one branch): edit temp file is `<module>.edit.fs` (editors
  filetype-detect Forth); `list` pages the current module file (BASIC's
  LIST, with a dirty-session note); `cancel;` abandons the definition being
  typed (immediate; disarms a pending `:e` — before this, the only cancel
  was typing an undefined word to force an error).
- [x] **Investigated + fixed: session broken after a stack underflow +
  aborted reload** (2026-07-13). Root cause: guard-fault recovery jumps to
  the REPL loop, abandoning whatever multi-step word was in flight.
  Cascade: (open-module) reseeded the log AFTER evaluating, so a faulted
  reload left the log holding the PREVIOUS module — a later `save`
  silently reverted the file, wiping on-disk edits (the reported data
  loss; the repeated "stack underflow" was each bare-edit quit re-running
  the same faulting reload until a save reverted the bad line away along
  with the user's work). Fixed: (1) (open-module) seeds the log BEFORE
  evaluating — save is always file-faithful; (2) `;` and (restore-dict)
  re-anchor the recovery snapshot (both arches), so a fault keeps every
  definition completed before the bad line and a fault after a forget
  can't resurrect forgotten words. Deferred (bounded, needs a fault-time
  cleanup registry): a faulted include leaks its open fd and read
  buffers.
- [~] **Language Reference coverage audit** — entries written (branch
  reference-gaps, 2026-07-18: all 79 gaps closed; survivors are 8 internals:
  hld lit >digit >digit? fill32 einval page-file chdir — that's the test's
  exclusion list). STILL TO DO: the regression test itself (live `words`
  output vs `## ` heading tokens in docs/Language-Reference/, pinned
  BASICFORTH_PATH), and the `binary` word (`: binary #2 base ! ;` beside
  decimal/hex — name `bin` is taken by the file-access modifier).
- [ ] **`help` / `tutorials` interface** (design agreed 2026-07-18):
  - Bare `help`: list every BASICFORTH_DOCS section except Tutorial (which
    gets a "type tutorials" pointer), topics **aligned in ~3 columns**
    (pad names to a fixed field width — the lister already sorts into a
    buffer), plus a 2-line footer: `help <topic>`, `help <word>`.
  - `help <name>`: exact topic match first → print the page **preamble**
    (top of file to the first `## ` heading — title, short intro,
    at-a-glance table); else scan `## ` heading tokens across the
    reference pages → print just that word's entry block (heading to the
    next `## `). Pages are already written to this convention.
  - Topic match folds case AND hyphen/underscore (fixes the old
    `man help-system` cross-reference bug below).
  - New `tutorials` word lists tutorials ("start one with: tutorial <name>").
  - Retire `man` and `topics`; keep `apropos`. Sweep remaining `man <topic>`
    references in docs/ root pages + Manual when the words land
    (Language-Reference already says `help ...`).
- [ ] **`see <word>` shows Language Reference usage** for primitives and
  core words (scan the reference pages for the word's heading — own doc
  scan, not a shell-out).
- [ ] **`:e`/`edit` dependency re-ordering** (the warning is proving
  annoying): move the fix's later-defined dependencies up to just before
  the edited word; move-to-end when the word has no callers. Design in
  Module_Architecture.md ("Forward references from a mutation").
- [ ] **Topic lessons** — short single-topic tutorials (`lesson`?); first:
  arrays (`create`/`allot`/`cells`), which also documents `allot`.
- [ ] **`.s` ignores BASE** (found 2026-07-16 debugging 1d-life): the asm
  primitive's print routine hard-codes divide-by-10, while `.` is redefined
  in core.fs with `<# #S #>` and respects BASE — so `2 base !  6 .s` shows
  `6` where `.` shows `110`. Standard Forths' `.S` follows BASE. Fix:
  redefine `.s` in core.fs base-aware (depth + non-destructive stack walk
  need `depth`/`pick` or direct sp0/DSP access). Audit siblings while
  there: any other asm printer that bypasses BASE (`.` primitive is
  shadowed; check H.2/H.ADDR are intentional hex).
- Rejected: shelling out to the real `man` (our docs are markdown; the
  board may not have man/less; our pager works everywhere).

### Open threads

- [x] **Pipes / output capture** — `open-pipe ( c-addr u fam -- fileid ior )`
  / `close-pipe ( fileid -- wretval wior )` (gforth-compatible) run a command
  with a pipe over its stdout (`r/o`) or stdin (`w/o`); the fileid works with
  the ordinary `read-line`/`write-line`, and `close-pipe` reaps the child and
  returns its exit status. `platform_popen`/`platform_pclose` +
  `(popen)`/`(pclose)`, both arches. Unlocks `history | grep`-style words and
  fzf pickers for `edit`/`load` (still to build, module arc). See
  docs/Shelling_Out.md.
- [ ] Ctrl-D exits without the dirty-guard prompt (EOF exits inside
  `platform_key`), so unsaved work can be lost silently.
- [ ] `man` doesn't map hyphens↔underscores, so some cross-references in the
  docs name topics that don't resolve (e.g. `man help-system` vs
  `Help_System.md`).

## Unix `#!` Script Support

Run a Forth file as an executable Unix script:
`chmod +x foo.fs` then `./foo.fs`, where the file begins with a
`#!/usr/bin/env basicforth` line. The kernel-level shebang mechanism and
command-line file loading already work; these tiers fill the gaps.

- [x] Tier 1 — Skip a leading `#!` shebang line
  - `forth_included` skips a leading `#!` first line (exact two-byte `#!`
    check, so a leading `#` decimal literal is unaffected; the shebang
    counts as line 1 so error line numbers stay accurate). Mirrored on
    x86-64 and ARM64.
  - Scripts that end in `bye` work end-to-end; see `examples/hello.fs`.
- [~] Tier 2 — Run-and-exit flag (no implicit REPL) — DECIDED NOT TO DO
  - The idea: a flag (e.g. `basicforth -s file.fs`) loads the file then exits
    instead of dropping into the REPL, so scripts need no explicit `bye`.
    Shebang form would be `#!/usr/bin/env -S basicforth -s`; no flag keeps
    today's "load then REPL" behavior (used by snake.fs).
  - Decision (2026-06): not worth it. GNU Forth (gforth) has no run-and-exit
    flag either — its documented way to exit after processing is to append
    `-e bye`, i.e. the same `bye` convention we already support. Ending a
    script with `bye` (see `examples/hello.fs`) is the mainstream Forth
    answer and is good enough.
  - The only thing a flag would add over the `bye` convention is clean
    exit-on-error with a non-zero exit status (a script that errors before
    `bye` currently drops into the REPL rather than failing).
  - UPDATE (2026-06): that remaining gap is now closed without a flag. A
    `script_running` flag is set around the startup script load; an error
    during it — a line error returned by INCLUDED, or a fault/ABORT/QUIT that
    recovers into repl_loop — exits non-zero instead of entering the REPL.
    (`rp0` is now initialized before the startup load so a fault there recovers
    onto a valid return stack.) core.fs load errors still drop to the REPL.
- [x] Tier 3 — Script arguments and exit codes  (DONE)
  - Enables writing Unix utilities / filters in Forth (read args + stdin,
    return a status). Both invocation forms give the same argv layout:
    `argv[0]`=interpreter, `argv[1]`=auto-loaded script, `argv[2..]`=user args:
    - `basicforth snake.fs level1.txt`
    - `./snake_start.fs level1.txt`  (shebang launcher that includes snake.fs)
  - Capture the full `argv` vector + `argc` at `_start` (we already save
    `argc` and `argv[1]`); this is startup/asm-word work, NOT a syscall — no
    new platform function needed for arg access.
  - Expose to Forth, mirroring gforth (variables + words) for portability:
    - `argc` — VARIABLE holding the current arg count (`argc @`)
    - `argv` — VARIABLE holding a pointer to the arg vector (`argv @` → char**)
    - `arg ( u -- c-addr u )` — uth arg as a string; `0 0` if out of range
    - `next-arg ( -- c-addr u )` — return arg[1] and consume it; `0 0` when empty
    - `shift-args ( -- )` — delete arg[1], shift the rest left, decrement
      `argc` (O(1): copy arg[0] forward, advance `argv`, dec `argc`)
    - At startup the auto-loaded script is shifted out, so `arg[0]` is the
      interpreter and the first user arg is `arg[1]` / first `next-arg`.
  - `bye-code ( n -- )` — exit with status n, silent (no "Goodbye!") so a
    utility's stdout isn't corrupted; plain `bye` keeps its message. This is
    the ONLY real platform-layer addition (an exit-with-status syscall
    wrapper); also closes the Tier 2 exit-on-error gap.
  - Mirror x86-64 and ARM64. Integration tests (args + `$?`); doc + example
    `examples/echo.fs` (a Forth `echo`).
  - Also added (option 2 of the banner decision): the startup banner now
    prints only when stdout is a terminal, so a utility's piped/redirected
    stdout is clean. New platform calls: `platform_exit`, `platform_isatty`.
  - NOTE: an arg gives you the *string*; reading that data file is separate —
    see Phase 4 (expose file-read words).

## Future / Hardening

- [ ] Replace `ld -N` with `mprotect` on dict_space at startup
  - Currently we use OMAGIC (`ld -N`) to make all segments RWX so compiled
    code in dict_space can execute.  The proper approach is to keep normal
    segment permissions and call `SYS_mprotect` on just the dict_space pages
    to add PROT_EXEC.  See BareMetalForth Lesson 37 for background.
- [ ] Guard page after dict_space for dictionary overflow detection
  - Currently dict_space uses a software CHECK_DICT macro.  A guard page
    would provide zero-cost hardware detection, consistent with the data
    stack approach.
