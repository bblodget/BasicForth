## Phase 4: File System and Storage

- [x] Output handles (step 2): `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` (fileid = raw OS fd),
  `write-file`/`write-line ( c-addr u fileid -- ior )`. `platform_write` split
  into `platform_write_fd` with a stdout wrapper; `TYPE`/`EMIT` unchanged.
  Lets a utility write to stderr without corrupting stdout.
- [x] Generic file-access words (step 3): `open-file`, `create-file`,
  `close-file`, `read-file`, `file-size`, and `r/o`/`w/o`/`r/w`/`bin`. fileid =
  raw OS fd, `ior` = 0/positive errno (same model as the output words). New
  `platform_read_file`; `platform_open_file` generalized to
  `platform_open_file_mode` (+ read-only wrapper) and `platform_create_file`;
  `platform_fstat` reports errors. Example `examples/cat.fs`.
- [x] `read-line ( c-addr u1 fileid -- u2 flag ior )` (step 4): one line per
  call — at most u1 chars stored (u2 <= u1), terminator (LF, preceding CR
  stripped) consumed not stored; `flag` false only at EOF with nothing read. A
  line longer than u1 fills the buffer and the rest is discarded so the next
  call starts at the following line (truncation, chosen over ANS continuation);
  no cross-call state, so multiple files / reused fds are always safe. Defined
  in core.fs on top of `read-file` (one byte per read()), so no new asm/platform
  code — a buffered version can replace it later behind the same interface.
- [x] Dynamic memory — ANS MEMORY wordset (`ALLOCATE`/`FREE`/`RESIZE`): a heap
  *separate* from the dictionary, obtained from the kernel on demand via
  anonymous `mmap` (one mapping per allocation, data-only/no-exec). New
  `platform_mmap_anon`; `munmap` reused. `ALLOCATE`/`FREE`/`RESIZE` defined in
  core.fs over `(mmap-anon)`/`(munmap)` primitives, with a one-cell length
  header and a portable allocate-copy-free `RESIZE`, so the internals can be
  re-backed by a finer allocator later. `ALLOCATE 0` returns a non-zero `ior`;
  page-granular, so suited to a few large buffers. This unblocks later ideas
  that need scratch storage (SAVE session log, help text, text-processing lib).
  Still deferred (harder, separate step): *growing the dictionary itself* — a
  `PROT_EXEC` mapping with a movable `HERE` (see WildIdeas / Future-Hardening).
- Block storage / `LOAD` / `LIST` / `THRU` (Forth screens) — **Won't do.** Block
  screens are a historical storage model; BasicForth already loads source from
  files via `INCLUDE`/`INCLUDED`, and the Phase 4 file-access words cover real
  file I/O, so block storage adds little.
- [x] SAVE / persistence of user definitions — source-replay. `save` writes
  interactively-defined words to `session.fs`; an interactive session auto-loads
  it at startup (after core.fs). Capture excludes transient actions (LATEST/STATE
  delta — bare ALLOT/,/C, are not captured), handles multi-line defs, discards
  errored defs; idempotent and
  cumulative. Heap-backed log; REPL hooks `(session-seed)`/`(capture-line)`/
  `(capture-reset)` registered via `(hook!)`; gated to interactive tty sessions
  (`BASICFORTH_SESSION=1`/`0` overrides). See docs/Persistence.md.
  - Known limitation: persists definitions, not runtime state (a `variable`
    reloads uninitialized). Redefinitions accumulate in the file.
- [x] `MARKER` — dictionary restore points (modern replacement for `FORGET`).
  `marker <name>` defines a word that rewinds `HERE`/`LATEST` to before the
  marker, forgetting it and all later definitions. `CREATE ... DOES>` in core.fs
  over `(latest@)`/`(restore-dict)` primitives. See docs/Marker.md. (`FORGET`
  deferred — obsolescent, footgun-prone; BareMetalForth also did marker-only.)
- [x] Session integration for `MARKER`: `-session` forgets the session
  definitions (rewinds to a restore point recorded just past core.fs, so core.fs
  and the session words survive) and `reload` does `-session` + re-`include`
  session.fs — the edit/compile/run loop. session.fs stays *pure definitions*:
  capture is forward-only (a marker run / `-session` moves LATEST backward and is
  not logged) and `reload` sets a one-shot skip flag. Implemented with an
  external restore point (`(session-mark!)`/`(session-restore)` globals) rather
  than a marker-in-the-file, so the file needs no `marker -session` header. See
  docs/Persistence.md.
- [x] `SEE` — source lister over the session capture log. `see <name>` prints a
  word's definition source (exactly as typed; multi-line and comments preserved).
  Resolves the name with `FIND` and matches the live xt, so it shows the
  definition currently in force and never stale source: a redefinition shadows the
  older one, and a word forgotten by `-session`/a marker reports not found. Works
  for any defining word; no new asm primitive. Small directory index (3-cell
  records [log-off, log-len, xt]) reset alongside the log in `(seed-log)`. See
  docs/See.md.
  - [x] Index seeded/reloaded definitions too. `(index-seeded)` parses the seeded
    log into definition groups (comment/string aware; `:` plus single-line
    `variable`/`constant`/`value`/`create`/`marker`/`2variable`/`2constant`) and
    indexes each, resolving names to their live xt via `FIND`. Runs on the first
    REPL tick at startup (deferred from `(session-init)` via `(seed-pending)`) and
    at the end of `reload`. So `see` now covers anything in `session.fs`.
  - Known MVP limitation: the seeded indexer recognises definitions by their
    defining word, so it does NOT cover words created by *user-defined* defining
    words (e.g. `5 my-const five`) — `see five` reports the honest "no source
    captured". And because a post-load text parser only knows a word's live xt
    (not which of several same-named defs is in force), there is a rare wrong-
    source edge: a built-in def *redefined* by a custom defining word
    (`1 constant x` … `2 my-const x`) shows the shadowed `1 constant x`. Both are
    the same attribution limit; common cases (incl. all-built-in redefinition)
    are correct. Resolved properly by:
  - Future: source-location metadata in the dictionary header → `see` for any
    file-loaded word (incl. `core.fs` and custom-defining-word words), primitives
    labelled, decompile far-future. See docs/WildIdeas.md.
- [~] ~~Bug: `INCLUDED` from inside a colon definition underflows the stack~~ —
  **not a bug.** `INCLUDED` is `( c-addr u -- )` per ANS (it leaves nothing on
  the stack; errors are printed, not returned as an ior). The earlier "underflow"
  was an erroneous `included drop` — the `drop` underflowed after the file
  loaded. `: load s" foo.fs" included ;` (no `drop`) works fine, which is what
  `reload` relies on. The SAVE startup still loads session.fs in asm, but that's
  now just a convenience, not a workaround.
- [x] **Fixed: `INCLUDE`/`INCLUDED` left the outer interpreter parsing a freed
  mmap.** `forth_included` overwrote `source_addr`/`source_len`/`to_in` with the
  file's lines but never restored the caller's values, then `munmap`ed the file.
  After the include the outer `forth_interpret_line` parsed from the (now freed)
  mapping. It only "worked" when `include` was the last token of a line *and* the
  file was fully consumed (so `to_in >= source_len` → no deref); any leftover
  token, or a compile-time error inside the file (which leaves `to_in` mid-line),
  dereferenced the freed page — wedging the REPL or **segfaulting** once the SAVE
  capture hooks were active. Fix: `forth_included` now saves the source pointers
  before the line loop and restores them on every loop-exit path (both arches).
  Bonus: tokens after `include <file>` on the same line now run correctly.
- [x] **Help system — docs browser (`man` / `topics` / `apropos`).** Reads the
  `*.md` topics in the colon-separated directories named by `BASICFORTH_DOCS`.
  `topics` lists them, `man <topic>` finds `<topic>.md` (case-insensitive) and
  pages it a screenful at a time, `apropos <keyword>` lists the topics whose file
  contains the keyword. New primitives: `(getdents)` (wraps `getdents64` for
  directory enumeration) and `(docs-path)` (exposes `BASICFORTH_DOCS`); getdents
  and pager buffers are heap-allocated. See Help_System.md. (Per-word
  `help <word>` is deferred to a later "Part A" — see WildIdeas.md.)
- [x] **Interactive tutorial (`tutorial` / `next` / `back`).** Walks a
  `BASICFORTH_DOCS` Markdown file one `## `-heading step at a time, returning to
  the REPL after each step so the reader can type the examples. Reuses the
  docs-browser machinery (file resolution, `read-line`, the pager line-printer).
  See Tutorial_System.md. (Content — the lesson set — is the follow-on task.)
- [x] **Dictionary space raised 64 KB → 256 KB** (`DICT_SPACE_SIZE`, both arches,
  BSS only). The shared dictionary was nearly full once large examples
  (`examples/sort.fs`) loaded alongside `core.fs`; `unused` now reports ~226 KB
  free.

## Phase 5: Graphics and Sound

- [ ] Framebuffer (/dev/fb0), DRM/KMS, or SDL2
- [ ] Font rendering
- [ ] Sound output (ALSA or PipeWire)
- [ ] Game demos (snake, sprites)

---

## Phase 6: Robotics

- [ ] GPIO access via /dev/gpiochip (Pumpkin 40-pin header)
- [ ] I2C / SPI sensor communication
- [ ] Real-time control loops

---

## Phase 7: Custom Linux Distribution

- [ ] Minimal Linux image with BasicForth as /sbin/init (PID 1)
- [ ] Boot straight to Forth prompt
- [ ] Built-in editor for standalone development

---

## Phase 8: Threading and Locals

- [ ] Locals word set (section 13) — Gforth-style separate locals stack
  - Separate locals stack (not return stack) to avoid conflicts with >R/R>
  - `{` syntax: `{ a b c -- result }` declares locals, pops from data stack
  - Each local name compiles to a locals-stack-relative fetch
  - TO works with locals (compile a locals-stack-relative store)
  - Reentrant and thread-safe (each thread gets its own locals stack)
  - Required for safe multi-threaded Forth words
- [ ] Threading support (pthreads or clone syscall)
  - Per-thread data stack, return stack, and locals stack
  - Shared dictionary (read-only after compilation)
  - Thread-local state: SOURCE, >IN, STATE, BASE
  - Synchronization primitives (mutex, semaphore)

---

## Future / Usability

- [x] `BASICFORTH_PATH` colon-separated directory search
  - Supports multiple directories separated by `:` (like PATH,
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
  - `BASICFORTH_PATH=/path/to/lib:/path/to/examples`
  - Each directory searched in order when a file is not found in CWD;
    first match wins. Empty segments are skipped.
- [x] Fix `incl_path_buf` for nested INCLUDED calls
  - `forth_included` now saves/restores `file_name_addr`, `file_name_len`,
    and `file_line_num` around the `forth_interpret_line` call, so a nested
    INCLUDE no longer corrupts the parent's error context (it was reporting
    the wrong file AND line).
  - `incl_path_buf` is now scratch-only: on a fallback hit the error name
    stays the original (as-typed) filename rather than the resolved path, so
    no error-reporting state depends on the shared buffer.

---

## Unix `#!` Script Support

Run a Forth file as an executable Unix script:
`chmod +x foo.fs` then `./foo.fs`, where the file begins with a
`#!/usr/bin/env basicforth` line. The kernel-level shebang mechanism and
command-line file loading already work; these tiers fill the gaps.

- [x] Tier 1 — Skip a leading `#!` shebang line
  - `forth_included` skips a leading `#!` first line (exact two-byte `#!`
    check, so a leading `#` decimal literal is unaffected; the shebang
    counts as line 1 so error line numbers stay accurate). Mirrored on
    x86-64 and ARM64.
  - Scripts that end in `bye` work end-to-end; see `examples/hello.fs`.
- [~] Tier 2 — Run-and-exit flag (no implicit REPL) — DECIDED NOT TO DO
  - The idea: a flag (e.g. `basicforth -s file.fs`) loads the file then exits
    instead of dropping into the REPL, so scripts need no explicit `bye`.
    Shebang form would be `#!/usr/bin/env -S basicforth -s`; no flag keeps
    today's "load then REPL" behavior (used by snake.fs).
  - Decision (2026-06): not worth it. GNU Forth (gforth) has no run-and-exit
    flag either — its documented way to exit after processing is to append
    `-e bye`, i.e. the same `bye` convention we already support. Ending a
    script with `bye` (see `examples/hello.fs`) is the mainstream Forth
    answer and is good enough.
  - The only thing a flag would add over the `bye` convention is clean
    exit-on-error with a non-zero exit status (a script that errors before
    `bye` currently drops into the REPL rather than failing).
  - UPDATE (2026-06): that remaining gap is now closed without a flag. A
    `script_running` flag is set around the startup script load; an error
    during it — a line error returned by INCLUDED, or a fault/ABORT/QUIT that
    recovers into repl_loop — exits non-zero instead of entering the REPL.
    (`rp0` is now initialized before the startup load so a fault there recovers
    onto a valid return stack.) core.fs load errors still drop to the REPL.
- [x] Tier 3 — Script arguments and exit codes  (DONE)
  - Enables writing Unix utilities / filters in Forth (read args + stdin,
    return a status). Both invocation forms give the same argv layout:
    `argv[0]`=interpreter, `argv[1]`=auto-loaded script, `argv[2..]`=user args:
    - `basicforth snake.fs level1.txt`
    - `./snake_start.fs level1.txt`  (shebang launcher that includes snake.fs)
  - Capture the full `argv` vector + `argc` at `_start` (we already save
    `argc` and `argv[1]`); this is startup/asm-word work, NOT a syscall — no
    new platform function needed for arg access.
  - Expose to Forth, mirroring gforth (variables + words) for portability:
    - `argc` — VARIABLE holding the current arg count (`argc @`)
    - `argv` — VARIABLE holding a pointer to the arg vector (`argv @` → char**)
    - `arg ( u -- c-addr u )` — uth arg as a string; `0 0` if out of range
    - `next-arg ( -- c-addr u )` — return arg[1] and consume it; `0 0` when empty
    - `shift-args ( -- )` — delete arg[1], shift the rest left, decrement
      `argc` (O(1): copy arg[0] forward, advance `argv`, dec `argc`)
    - At startup the auto-loaded script is shifted out, so `arg[0]` is the
      interpreter and the first user arg is `arg[1]` / first `next-arg`.
  - `bye-code ( n -- )` — exit with status n, silent (no "Goodbye!") so a
    utility's stdout isn't corrupted; plain `bye` keeps its message. This is
    the ONLY real platform-layer addition (an exit-with-status syscall
    wrapper); also closes the Tier 2 exit-on-error gap.
  - Mirror x86-64 and ARM64. Integration tests (args + `$?`); doc + example
    `examples/echo.fs` (a Forth `echo`).
  - Also added (option 2 of the banner decision): the startup banner now
    prints only when stdout is a terminal, so a utility's piped/redirected
    stdout is clean. New platform calls: `platform_exit`, `platform_isatty`.
  - NOTE: an arg gives you the *string*; reading that data file is separate —
    see Phase 4 (expose file-read words).

## Future / Hardening

- [ ] Replace `ld -N` with `mprotect` on dict_space at startup
  - Currently we use OMAGIC (`ld -N`) to make all segments RWX so compiled
    code in dict_space can execute.  The proper approach is to keep normal
    segment permissions and call `SYS_mprotect` on just the dict_space pages
    to add PROT_EXEC.  See BareMetalForth Lesson 37 for background.
- [ ] Guard page after dict_space for dictionary overflow detection
  - Currently dict_space uses a software CHECK_DICT macro.  A guard page
    would provide zero-cost hardware detection, consistent with the data
    stack approach.
